    <h2>What Do You Enjoy?</h2>

    <h3>Modifying Vehicles</h3>
    <p>One of my greatest intersts is modifying the looks and performance of vehicles. It gives me a sense of relaxation and satisfaction. My first car was a 2002 Honda Civic that I loved dearly. Even before my first car I had tremendous interest in automobiles. Me being a very visual person, an automobile's design evokes a sense of emotion much in the way that most other people see pieces of art. My interest in modifying automobiles was one of the reasons I choose to do my first degree in Mechanical Engineering.

    <h3>Reading</h3>
    <p>The act of reading is a skill I place tremendous value on becuase it allows me to gain insight into subject areas from some of the worlds most knowledgable individuals. Reading like modifying cars gives me a sense of relaxation especially with the assurance that I am going to bed a little smarter than I did yesterday. Non-fiction is my genre of choice because its realistic element appeals to my intuition more than its fictional counterpart.

    <h3>Web Development</h3>
    <p>Web development is also one of my favorite interest. It is one of the major reasons why I went into the Software Engineering field. I am currently doing many different types of prograaming languages, however the my favorite course is web development. I believe its because of its ubiquity and also because it is significantly changing our behaviour as human beings. I enjoy the design proesss in web development as it allows me to see immediate results unlike other fields.
